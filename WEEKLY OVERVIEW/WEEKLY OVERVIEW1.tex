					\underline{	\textbf{WEEK4}}\\
						
-We had a virtual meeting on WhatsApp Messenger app discussing the progress of the project.\\
-Applying for dedicated self managed server (Afrihost) proved costly and time consuming,with costs approximately R1000 a month.\\
-It came to our attention that to get access to Facebook data would take approximately a week since we had to apply to get it.\\
-As a solution,we reached a consensus on using twitter data over the Facebook one.\\
-We then updated our SRS document.\\
-After a series of meetings which were subsequently held on a Whatsapp Messnger app ,with every group member present.We had a face to face meeting.Refer to meeting Memo documents for more information.\\
-On the same week we had another face to face meeting ,refer to Meeting Memo Documents for more information. \\
-Documents were drawn up after every(physical) meeting we had and pushed to GitHub by the group leader.
