\section{Introduction}
\subsection{GitHub}
For now I have created a repository \url{https://github.com/TJ721988/SEgroup9}, hope that's correct.

\subsection{Project outline}
Graphically represent a database, with which the user can interact: manipulate structures, shapes and colours. 
Nodes represent individual people or groups, while links symbolise the connection(friends, like a page, join a group...)
\subsubsection{Back-end}
The back-end is a Neo4j database, starting with 3 basic tables; People, Groups, Pages
Groups and Pages are just lists of various groups, perhaps some properties too.
People to be updated every time a new person joins the network, the table links to the Groups and Pages through foreign keys,

\subsubsection{Front-end}
The front-end interface displays the results of queries graphically. 
Not sure if the data just needs to be displayed or we need to identify and show patterns within the data. 

\subsection{Todo list}
\subsubsection{All}
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn LaTeX basics
\item Get an understanding of Neo4j and Neo4j Browser
\item Refresh JSON and XML

\item findout due date, to nail down a project plan

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Back-end}
Clifford to set up the initial database
\subsubsection{Front-end}
Lindiwe and Thomas to work on data retrieval, display and manipulation,

\subsection{Design}
The input should allow data to be entered into the database, as well as to allow graphic manipulation\\
The output should be a graphic representation of the connections in the network

Work load may need to be distributed, once we know which part will be the most work.
