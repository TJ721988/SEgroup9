\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
Social media plays a vital role in everyday people lives. There is enormous information about individuals and how they relate to one another. This information is useful to individuals, advertisers, politicians and many other organisations. The purpose of our software is to provide means to get links between individuals in social media. Our first focus will be analysing Facebook links using Neo4j database via the website.

\subsection{Scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Create a database using Neo4j to store our social media data (Clifford)
\item Find out about the legal implications of using Facebook data (Lindiwe)
\item Register with Facebook to enable them to give us access to their data (Lindiwe)
\item Create a beautiful easy to use web interface (Thomas/Lindiwe)
\item Testing of the software (Clifford/Thomas/Lindiwe)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle
\item UC: use case
\item GD: graph database(Neo4j)
\end{itemize}

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective }
Since this is the first software we are producing, there no other programs to interface with. With this program you will be able to understand your interaction in Facebook as an individual. 
The program will be expected to deliver on the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Find the person who liked your posts the most
\item Find the people who unfriended you within given period
\item Find the person who commented on your posts the most
\end{itemize}

\subsection{product functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item This programwill be designed in Client-Server model
\item The front end will  be through the Neo4j browser and the back end will be done in Neo4j
\item The program is expected to have a fast response 
\item The program is expected to do at least three different data analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user will have to be willing to share their Facebook data with our program
\item The program should be able to handle at least five users without affecting the user experience
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Constraint}
Obtaining permission from Facebook to use their data, else acquire similar data from another source

\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
\item Facebook will grant us access to their data
\item There will be a server where we can run the program
\end{itemize}

\section{Detailed Requirements}
\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interfaces (Thomas)}
The Neo4j browser offers easy to use manipulation tools and a nice graphic visualisation, it's the best choice among many similar tools due the compatibility with the Neo4j database.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces (Clifford)}
The only Hardware interface that will be required for this project is the computer that will be used to program and save the database for this project
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces (Clifford)}
Neo4j will be used as the database for this project and the browser afforded by Neo4j will be the first choice if feasible as the user interface. At the moment Java or Python are the front runners to be used for the back-end programming. Java because Neo4j supports native Java and Python because many data science libraries are written in Python

\subsection{Function Requirements}
\subsubsection{Back-end requirements}
UC1: Find the person who liked your posts the most
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary actor: The account holder
\item Precondition: The account holder has logged in
\item keep track of likes and unlikes of the primary actor
\end{itemize}

UC2: Find the people who unfriended you within the given period
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary actor: The account holder
\item Precondition: The account holder has logged in
\item keep track of friending and unfriending from primary actor
\item track the time of the actions, to compare to given period
\end{itemize}

UC3: Find the person who commented the most in a period
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary actor: The account holder
\item Precondition: The account holder has logged in
\item keep track of the incoming comments on primary actor
\item add the time period to compare to given period
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Front-end requirements}
Represent different actions by different connects between nodes

UC1: Likes
Find a may to make a repeated action noticeable, either thicker line, different style line or different colour

UC2: Unfriends
Show newly established friendships as a colour(green) and unfriends as a different colour(grey)

UC3: Posts
Similar to UC1, don't show actions not within given period or change their style(dotted line)

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\subsubsection{Intuitiveness}
The database and representation should be as logical as possible, and as easy to use, maintain and modify as manageable. 
A simple design will decrease database queries to improve response time

\subsubsection{Speed}
The speed of execution is important. Neo4j is faster than MySql Relational Database Management System. Expected response time of 15 seconds 90\% of the time.

\subsubsection{Agility}
The system is to be naturally adaptive, with the flexibility to add and remove data from the database

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Elimination of duplicated data
\item Ease of use
\item Consistency
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security}
As the data is personal it should be secured, so no other can view it, and anonymised.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
Maintenance should be possible and easy and allow for the implementation of new functions

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Hardware}
Our software uses Neo4j database,Neo4j’s storage is organized in record-based files per data structure – nodes, relationships, properties, labels, and so on. Each node and relationship record block is directly addressable by its id.Nodes occupy 15B
of space, relationships occupy 31B of space and properties occupy 41B of space.The low level cache requirements are the same as for the disk space.The
system  will  be  integrated  with  a  website.  To  use  recommendation  system,user 
should enter from a personal computer,mobile device with internet connection.

\subsubsection{User direct interaction constraints}
This project is expected to use the graph database to
manage large samples of database from Facebook of nodes (members) and links (connections
between nodes.The softwaare will be pretty static software,preventing users from enacting personalized websites layout.It will only use the data from facebook.This does not allow much room for creative customizability of a user's profile.
